Simplified interactive bar menu made with react. 
When you click the menu positions, they get active (change color and font weight) and make your order. The sum you have to pay is shown. 
Once your order reaches 3 positions (or is larger), you get entitled to 10% discount which is shown in the footer's total sum.

The settings used for this project are suitable for development only and very convenient for learning because they use in-browser babel compiler. 
Since the settings don't support moduls, they're simuleted by creating separated files.
The project was verified using http-server.
